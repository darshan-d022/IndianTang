I have used JSON format to ingest data to the chat bot. The file chat_bot iterates through this JSON file to get tags and responses. 
This data is then fed to a neural network consisting of 5 layers. 
The model is saved.
I have written various functions to call the zomato API.
The file bot.py loads the model and gives response to users query.
